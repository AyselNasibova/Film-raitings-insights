# 🎬 IMDb Films Analysis with Python

A data-driven exploratory analysis of popular films using IMDb data. This project utilizes Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib) in a Jupyter Notebook environment to uncover trends, insights, and visualizations from a movie dataset.

## 📌 Project Overview

This notebook explores a film dataset with a focus on:
- Genre distribution
- Release year trends
- IMDb rating patterns
- Duration analysis
- Most frequent directors
- Country-wise production counts

By visualizing and cleaning the data, this project helps understand what defines popular films and how certain features (like genre or country) affect film production and ratings.
